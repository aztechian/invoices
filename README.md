invoices
========

Django application for invoicing.

Uses Django for models, views and some templating. Attempting to put a "modern" front end on the UI/UX, using things such as Twitter bootstrap, jQuery, x-editable.

Very soon, I'd expect to switch this over to the Django views only outputting JSON, making it a service, and have an independent front end. This would also allow something like a single-page web application.
